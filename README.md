# ChildNav
A WordPress plugin to display child (and parent) pages.

#### This plugin wonâ€™t list pages for the main blog page or any of the posts.

## Possible TODOs
* Add a title option
* Elect to show parent page as title or link
* ADD pages to list, not just ONLY include

## Notes
* Include ONLY includes pages listed
* Shortcode attributes: depth, include, exclude, sort
