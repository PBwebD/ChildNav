# ChildNav
A WordPress plugin to display child (and parent) pages.

## Possible TODOs
* Add a title option
* Elect to show parent page as title or link
* ADD pages to list, not just ONLY include
* Option to indicate current page and options for how to show it

## Notes
* Include ONLY includes pages listed
* Shortcode attributes: depth, include, exclude, sort
* Depth: -1 is a list, 0 is a nested list, 1 is 1 level, etc
* Won’t list pages for the main blog page or any of the posts.
